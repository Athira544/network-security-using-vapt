The Automated VAPT Reporting Tool is a comprehensive solution that automates the process of conducting vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) on a target system or network. The tool leverages the power of Nmap, a popular and powerful network scanning tool, along with OpenVAS (GVM), a widely used vulnerability management and assessment tool, to perform automated scans and generate detailed reports in PDF format.

The main functionalities of the Automated VAPT Reporting Tool include:

Nmap Scanning: The tool uses Nmap to scan the target system or network for open ports, services running on those ports, and OS detection. The results are collected and stored for further analysis.

OpenVAS (GVM) Integration: The tool connects to OpenVAS (GVM) via the GVM command-line interface (CLI) using the provided credentials. It establishes a connection and uses OpenVAS (GVM) to conduct vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on the target system or network.

Report Generation: The tool generates comprehensive PDF reports for both the Nmap scan results and the OpenVAS (GVM) scan report. The reports are formatted in tabular form for easy analysis and understanding of the findings. The tool provides options for customizing the appearance and content of the reports, such as specifying the target IP address, port range, and other scan parameters.

Automation: The tool automates the entire process of conducting VAPT scans, collecting results, and generating reports, reducing the manual effort and time required for conducting such assessments.

Flexibility: The tool is highly customizable and can be easily adapted to different environments and requirements. It provides options for specifying scan parameters, report formatting, and other customization options to suit the specific needs of the users.

User-friendly Interface: The tool provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to input scan parameters, view scan progress, and generate reports with ease. It also provides informative and interactive reports that are easy to understand and interpret.

The Automated VAPT Reporting Tool is designed for security professionals, system administrators, and other stakeholders involved in conducting VAPT assessments. It provides a streamlined and automated approach to vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, helping organizations identify and mitigate potential security risks in their systems and networks.

Technologies Used:
1)Nmap: A widely used network scanning tool for discovering open ports, services, and operating systems on remote hosts.
2)OpenVAS (GVM): A popular open-source vulnerability management and assessment tool that provides comprehensive vulnerability scanning and reporting capabilities.
3)Python: A powerful scripting language used for automating the scanning and reporting process.
4)Python Libraries: Various Python libraries for interacting with Nmap, GVM, and generating PDF reports, such as python-nmap, gvm-tools, and ReportLab.
5)Command-line Interface (CLI): Interactions with Nmap and GVM are done via the command-line interface (CLI) using subprocess or similar libraries in Python.
